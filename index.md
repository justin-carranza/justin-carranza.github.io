### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    For lab 4, part 2, my partner and I coded a Hi-Lo game with if statements. The reason I liked this lab so much was because the Hi-Lo game is a very fun game to play with friends, with it being a very simple but entertaining game. Also, I liked learning the power of if statements knowing how many if statements we used when coding this game.

* Lab 6

    For lab 6, part 2, my partner and I coded a black jack calculation based on the cards inputted into the command line argument. The reason I liked this lab so much was because I love playing black jack with friends and family at family gatherings. Also, I liked learning the power of command line arguments knowing how important they are when it comes to coding in general.

* Lab 8

    For lab 8, part 2, I coded an arithmetic mean calculator that dealt with command line arguments. The reason I liked this lab so much was because although I worked on it by myself, I liked the struggle I had to go through in order to get the end result of the calculation. It brought a realization of how difficult coding can be even when it comes to the simplest mistake. It took me a whole day to figure out that a bool statement had to be claimed outside of the for statement and once I fixed it, I was mad at myself but also relieved it was finally over.
